# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node

npx hardhat --network mumbai run scripts/deploy.fuzion.ts
npx hardhat --network mumbai run scripts/deploy.airdrop.ts
```
